### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer currently interested in cloud application delivery, reliability, and observability. Lately I have been working heavily with Kubernetes, Kafka, Prometheus, Argo CD, and Open Policy Agent. I love getting to use open-source software, and am happy to contribute back when possible.

My pronouns are he/him/his.
