### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer currently interested in cloud application delivery, reliability, and observability. Over the last few years I have gained significant experience in managing and utilizing Kubernetes, Kafka, Prometheus, Argo CD, Open Policy Agent, and many other tools and technologies. I love getting to use open-source software, and am happy to contribute back when possible.

My pronouns are he/him/his.
